# Movie Recommender System: User Based Collaborative Filtering - A CS 4675 Project

Author: [Shiyi Wang](mailto:swang793@gatech.edu)

## Introduction

This is a movie recommender system utilizing user-based collaborative filtering in Python. The training dataset is the [MovieLens 20M Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset?select=movie.csv) from Kaggle.

## Getting Started

### Setup

In order to run the movie recommender system on Jupytor Notebook, you need to install the following python libraries.

* [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html)
* [pprint](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html)
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)

### General Usage

Please run the following command in the index directory.

```sh
jupyter notebook movieRecSys.ipynb 
```
Inside Jupyter Notebook, click on `Run All` to execute.
### Runnng Time Notes

The running time varies amomg diffrent machines. On Macbook Pro (2019):
* Total running time: ~ 3 minutes
* The visualization module: ~ 1 minute
* KNN training time: ~ 30 seconds


## Deliverables
